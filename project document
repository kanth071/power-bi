Title
Malnutrition Analysis Across the Globe Using Power BI
1. Introduction
Malnutrition remains one of the most critical global health challenges, affecting children and adults across different income groups and regions. It includes conditions such as underweight, stunting, wasting, and overweight, which directly impact mortality, productivity, and long-term development.
This project focuses on analyzing global malnutrition indicators using data visualization and business intelligence techniques to identify patterns, trends, and high-risk regions.
2. Objective of the Project
The main objectives of this project are:
To analyze malnutrition indicators across countries and income classifications
To compare stunting, wasting, underweight, and overweight statistics
To provide interactive visual insights for decision-makers
To identify high-risk regions requiring urgent policy intervention
3. Scope of the Project
Covers global malnutrition data
Compares indicators across countries and income classifications
Provides summarized KPIs and detailed visual analysis
Designed for health analysts, policymakers, and researchers
4. Dataset Description
The dataset used includes the following attributes:
Key Fields
Country
Income Classification
Stunting
Wasting
Underweight
Overweight
Year / Survey Data
Measures Created
Sum of Stunting
Sum of Wasting
Sum of Underweight
Sum of Overweight
Total Survey Count
5. Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI Desktop
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
Excel / CSV Dataset
Data Modeling & Relationships
Interactive Visualizations
6. Dashboard Design Overview
The dashboard titled “Malnutrition Across the Globe” is designed with a clear, visually appealing layout using rounded cards and consistent color themes.
Key Dashboard Components
KPI Cards
Bar Charts
Area Charts
Line Charts
Stacked Visuals
7. Dashboard Components Explanation
7.1 KPI Cards
Count of Wasting: Displays total wasting cases
Sum of Stunting: Shows total stunting cases (in millions)
Sum of Underweight: Displays total underweight count
These cards give a quick snapshot of global malnutrition severity.
7.2 Malnutrition by Income Classification
Stacked Bar + Line Chart
Shows Stunting, Wasting, and Underweight by income groups
Helps compare malnutrition prevalence between low, middle, and high-income countries
Line indicates overall trend of stunting
Insight:
Lower-income groups show significantly higher malnutrition indicators.
7.3 Underweight by Country
Area/Line Chart
Displays underweight levels across countries
Highlights countries with the highest burden of undernutrition
Insight:
Certain regions contribute disproportionately to global underweight cases.
7.4 Overweight vs Underweight Analysis
Stacked Area Chart
Compares overweight and underweight cases across income classifications
Shows the double burden of malnutrition
Insight:
Middle-income countries experience both undernutrition and rising overweight cases.
8. Data Modeling
Proper relationships created between:
Country
Income Classification
Nutrition Indicators
Measures created using DAX for aggregation and KPIs
Filters applied at visual and page level
9. Key Insights & Findings
Low-income countries have the highest stunting and wasting levels
Middle-income countries show a mix of underweight and overweight
Underweight remains dominant in specific regions
Malnutrition patterns vary significantly by income level
10. Challenges Faced
Handling missing and inconsistent data
Managing multiple indicators in one dashboard
Designing a clean UI without visual clutter
Ensuring accurate aggregation using DAX
11. Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how Power BI can be used to transform raw global health data into meaningful insights. The dashboard enables users to quickly understand malnutrition trends and supports data-driven decision-making for health policy and planning.
12. Future Enhancements
Add time-based trend analysis
Include geographical maps
Integrate real-time WHO or UNICEF data
Add drill-through pages for country-level insights
Predictive analysis using ML integration
13. Applications
